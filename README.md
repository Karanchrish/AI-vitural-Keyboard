# AI Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to create a virtual keyboard using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By detecting hand positions and movements, users can interact with the keyboard interface displayed on the screen and input text.

## Features

- Hand tracking and detection using OpenCV
- Virtual keyboard interface
- Gesture-based typing
- Real-time text input display

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-hand-gesture-keyboard.git
   ```
2. Adjust the webcam if necessary to ensure your hand is properly detected.

3. Use your hand gestures to interact with the virtual keyboard displayed on the screen.

4. See the real-time text input displayed at the bottom of the screen.
